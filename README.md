# Data-Analysis-Project
A brief understanding of the project:

This project analyses auto claims data from an insurance company in the Southwest and Western U.S. regions. With declining profitability, the goal is to explore trends in claims, customer behaviour, and policy effectiveness. Using the claims_df dataset, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate actionable insights and recommendations to improve pricing strategies and profitability.
